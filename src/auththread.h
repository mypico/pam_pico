 * @brief Fuctionality for managing the authentication process
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Each authentication is managed separately. This AuthThread structure
 * manages a single authentication, including the sending of beacons out to
 * potentially multiple nearby devices.
 *
 * Previously threads were used to support asynchronous operation, but this has
 * now been changed to an event-based process that utilises a GMainLoop.
 *
 * The authentication session is kicked off by calling auththread_start_auth().
 *
 * Each session is mortal, so will eventually complete of its own accord (either
 * as a result of an authentication attempt, a timeout, or the dbus owner
 * that kicked things off being lost). There is therefore usually no need to
 * stop a session forcefully.
 *
 * The lifetime of each AuthThread is managed by ProcessStore.
 *
 * Each AuthThread manages several other objects:
 *
 * 1. AuthConfig for handling the configuration of the authentication.
 * 2. BeaconThread for sending out beacons.
 * 3. Service for actually performing an authentication.

/**
 * @brief The states that each Auth Thread can take
 *
 * The states in this enum encapsulate the lifecycle of an AuthThread. On
 * creation the session starts with a state of AUTHTHREADSTATE_INVALID. Once
 * the session has been started it moves to the AUTHTHREADSTATE_STARTED state.
 * In this state it will wait for a Pico app to connect and attempt to perform
 * the authentication protocol, while potentially sending out beacons.
 *
 * The session remains in the AUTHTHREADSTATE_STARTED state until an
 * authentication completes (with either success or failure), a timeout
 * occurs (in which case the authentication is deemed to have failed), or the
 * dbus connection losses it owner (in which case the authentication result is
 * irrelevant, since we've got nowhere to send it back to). The session then
 * moves into the AUTHTHREADSTATE_COMPLETED state.
 *
 * Once in the AUTHTHREADSTATE_COMPLETED the result can be returned to pam_pico
 * for action.
 *
 * If pam_pico requested for continuous authentication at the outset, the
 * session will then move into the AUTHTHREADSTATE_CONTINUING state and
 * continuously authenticate to the Pico app until authentication fails, the
 * app disconnects, or the app stops authenticating. It may therefore remain in
 * this state for some time. Note that we don't care about losing the dbus
 * owner in this case, since it should already have lost interest (PAMs don't
 * handle continuous authentication).
 *
 * The last thing a session does before finishing is to move itself into the
 * AUTHTHREADSTATE_HARVESTABLE state. In this state, the data associated with
 * the session will be released for re-use the next time the
 * processstore_harvest() function is called (which, by default, occurs just
 * prior to any new processes being added).
