 * @brief Send Bluetooth beacons out to a specific device
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * In order for a nearby Pico to know that there's a machine to log in to
 * there are one of two approaches. The first is for the user to scan a
 * QR code on the device using their Pico. The second is for the Pico to receive
 * a beacon from the device over a Bluetooth channel. This works for Bluetooth
 * because it's 'proximity'-based. That is, the beacon will only be received
 * if the two devices are near one another.
 *
 * This file provides support for contacting a specific device (specified
 * using a Bluetooth MAC) and sending it a beacon, which is a JSON string
 * containing enough information for the Pico to get in contact with the
 * device prior to authentication.
 *
 * This code is used by the beaconthread.c code, which provides support for
 * calling the beaconsend code for multiple devices.
 *
 * The operation of beaconsend is asynchronous and uses a GMainLoop in order to
 * operate using events.
