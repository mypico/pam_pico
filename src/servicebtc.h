 * @brief Provides Bluetooth Classic event support to tie to FsmService
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * FSMService provides only a framework of callbacks and events, but without
 * any way of communicating. The communication channel has to be tied to it
 * to make it work. This code provides the implementation of the callbacks to
 * allow the state machine to work with a Bluetooth Classic channel in order
 * to actually support authentication.
 *
 * On top of this, it also controls the sending of Bluetooth beacons to other
 * devices to notify them that they can authenticate.
 *
 * The execution of this code is managed by AuthThread, while this code uses
 * BeaconThread to manage the sending of beacons and FsmService from libpico
 * to manage the authentication control flow.
